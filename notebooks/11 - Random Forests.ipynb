The larger the better, but also the longer it will take to compute. The latter is the size of the random subsets of features to consider when splitting a node. The lower the greater the reduction of variance, but also the greater the increase in bias. Empirical good default values are `max_features=n_features` for regression problems, and `max_features=sqrt(n_features)` for classification tasks (where `n_features` is the number of features in the data). The best results are also usually reached when setting `max_depth=None` in combination with `min_samples_split=1` (i.e., when fully developing the trees)."
